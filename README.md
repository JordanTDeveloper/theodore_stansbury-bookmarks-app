# theodore_stansbury-bookmarks-app

The user can add a bookmark that that contains a title, url link, description of website, and a rating from one to five. 
You can delete the bookmark and select from a dropdown menu of the bookmarks they want to show based of the rating they inputted. 
The list is condensed when you first open the app, if you have bookmarks already stored. 
Clicking on the list will show the details.
