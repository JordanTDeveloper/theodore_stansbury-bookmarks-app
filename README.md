# The Bookmarks App

The user can add a bookmark that that contains a title, url link, description of website, and a rating from one to five. 
You can select from a dropdown menu of the bookmarks you want to display based off the rating the user inputted. 
The list is condensed when you first open the app, if you have bookmarks already stored. 
Clicking on the bookmark title will show the details of that bookmark.
Within the details, the user can visit the website by clicking on the link.
You can delete the bookmark, as well.
